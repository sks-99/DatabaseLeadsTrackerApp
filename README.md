# Leads Tracking Application

Welcome to my Leads Tracking Web application

The purpose of this application is to allow a user to save URLS which are considered leads into a Firebase database.
There is also a delete all button functionality that allows a user to remove their potential leads and start over!

## How to run this application

(1) Save the folder to your local desktop
(2) View the folder on Visual Studio Code
(3) Right Click Index HTML and open a live server
(4) Start adding your leads!!! :D

Happy Coding!
